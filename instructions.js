// We’d like you to develop a simple product reservation page for bike rentals. Please use the attached JSON data, and provide the user with the option to rent bikes. The test should not take more than 2 hours to complete. Requirements:

// You have the option to use any technologies available to you, or simple HTML, CSS, and JS.

// The test should include a complete checkout process, 
    // which means users should be able to select the type of product, 
    // select the number of product, 
    // view a summary before checkout, 
    // and in the end, check out. 
    
// Please think about how a checkout process usually is and make the checkout experience as smooth as possible.

// Users cannot check out with accessories or add-ons only - they must come with a bike selection.

// The content displayed should be responsive for mobile and desktop. Be mindful of element sizes and alignment.

// You can use a UI design you are comfortable with. The design doesn’t have to be fancy but the page should be organized and easy to navigate.

// Provide access to the see the code and a live demo link to see the page working.

// Please return your test within 7 days of this email.
